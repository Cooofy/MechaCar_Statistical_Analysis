# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

### Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition

1.) What metric or metrics are you going to test?

Miles per gallons, horse power, maintenance cost and safety rating.

2.) What is the null hypothesis or alternative hypothesis?

The null hypothesis would be the following for the miles per gallon metric:
Mean MechaCar vechicles' miles per gallon >= Mean Competitor vechicles' miles per gallon

3.) What statistical test would you use to test the hypothesis? And why?

The statistical test used would be the two sample, one sided t-test since it's a comparison between the means from two difference samples.

4.) What data is needed to run the statistical test?

The data needed to perform this test would be a sample of cars from MechaCar and a competitor with the miles per gallon, horse power, maintenance cost and safety rating for each car.
